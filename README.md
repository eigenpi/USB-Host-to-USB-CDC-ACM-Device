# USB Host to USB CDC-ACM Device Communication Experiments

## Description

This is a repository that contains complete source code for several
experiments, where I test communication via USB between two entities:
a "USB Host" and a "USB CDC-ACM Device". Please see individual README 
files for details on each experiment/project.

NOTE:
This is work in progress in that so far only the first two experiments
are complete and cleaned-up. When everything will be done and update, this 
note will be removed.

Here is the list of experiments:

   "USB Host"           <----> "USB CDC-ACM Device"
---------------------------------------------------
1) Arduino Uno + Shield <----> Arduino Uno
2) Nucleo C071RB        <----> Arduino Uno
3) ESP32                <----> Arduino Uno
4) Arduino Uno + Shield <----> NanoVNA-H4
5) Raspberry Pi 4       <----> NanoVNA2 Plus4
